# Content API. Filtering and selecting content

## Search and selection of content

Text input fields provide semantic selection of content by name, description, genres, actors and release date.

Possible semantic search queries <br/>
`by name`: "Green Mile", "watch Pulp Fiction" <br/>
`according to the description`: "films about naval battles", "TV series about schoolchildren and magic" <br/>
`by genre`: "comedies", "watch arthouse" <br/>
`by actors`: "Jared Leto", "films with Johnny Depp" <br/>
`by release date`: "2010", "films of 2022" <br/>

## Filtering and sorting of content in the `catalog`

As a user, I can filter and sort the displayed list of content.

Sorting takes place according to the following parameters:
- by name
- by popularity
- by rating
- by views
- according to the latest updates (when adding content or updating a series/media file in it)
- in random order

Sorting can occur from more to less or vice versa.

Filtering occurs by one or more parameters at the same time:
- by type [movies | TV series | traditional animation | anime] <span style="color: red">(in the future)</span>
- by genre
- by country
- by age rating [0+ | 16+ | 18+]
- project status [announcement | coming out | completed] <span style="color: red">(in the future)</span>
- by period or year of issue

According to similar parameters, it is possible to **exclude** certain content from the output. 

Sorting can be applied to filtering, and the parameters can be expanded in the future.
